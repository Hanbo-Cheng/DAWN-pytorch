## TODO list:
- [x]  release the inference code
- [x]  release the pretrained model of **128*128**
- [x]  release the pretrained model of **256*256** 
- [x] release the unified test code
- [ ] in progress ...


## Equipment Requirements

With our VRAM-oriented optimized [code](DM_3/modules/video_flow_diffusion_multiGPU_v0_crema_plus_faceemb_ca_multi_test_local_opt.py), the maximum length of video that can be generated is **linearly related** to the size of the GPU VRAM. Larger VRAM produce longer videos.
- To generate **128*128** video, we recommend using a GPU with **12GB** or more VRAM. This can at least generate video of approximately **400 frames**.
- To generate **256*256** video, we recommend using a GPU with **24GB** or more VRAM. This can at least generate video of approximately **200 frames**.

PS: Although optimized [code](DM_3/modules/video_flow_diffusion_multiGPU_v0_crema_plus_faceemb_ca_multi_test_local_opt.py) can improve VRAM utilization, it currently sacrifices inference speed due to incomplete optimization of local attention. We are actively working on this issue, and if you have a better solution, we welcome your PR. If you wish to achieve faster inference speeds, you can use [unoptimized code](DM_3/modules/video_flow_diffusion_multiGPU_v0_crema_plus_faceemb_ca_multi_test.py), but this will increase VRAM usage (O(n²) spatial complexity).
## Methodology
### The overall structure of DAWN:

<img src="structure_img\pipeline.png" width=600 alt="framework"/>
</p>


## Environment
We highly recommend to try DAWN on linux platform. Runing on windows may produce some rubbish files need to be deleted manually and requires additional effort for the deployment of the 3DDFA repository (our `extract_init_states` folder) [comment](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2/issues/12#issuecomment-697479173).

1. set up the conda environment
```
conda create -n DAWN python=3.8
conda activate DAWN
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Follow the [readme](extract_init_states/readme.md) and [3DDFA_V2](https://github.com/cleardusk/3DDFA_V2) to set up the 3DDFA environment.
 

## Inference

Since our model **is trained only on the HDTF dataset** and has few parameters, in order to ensure the best driving effect, please provide examples of :
- standard human photos as much as possible, try not to wear hats or large headgear
- ensure a clear boundary between the background and the subject
- have the face occupying the main position in the image.

The preparation for inference:
1. Download the pretrain checkpoints from [hugging face](https://huggingface.co/Hanbo-Cheng/DAWN). Create the `./pretrain_models` directory and put the checkpoint files into it. Please down load the Hubert model from [facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft](https://huggingface.co/facebook/hubert-large-ls960-ft/tree/main). 
      ```
      directory structure:

      pretrain_models/
            ├── LFG_256_400ep.pth
            ├── LFG_128_1000ep.pth
            ├── DAWN_256.pth
            ├── DAWN_128.pth
            ├── pbnet-seperate/
            |     ├── .....
            └── hubert-large-ls960-ft/
                  ├── .....
      ```

2. Run the inference script: 
   ```
   python unified_video_generator.py  \
      --audio_path your/audio/path  \
      --image_path your/image/path  \
      --output_path output/path \
      --cache_path cache/path \
      --resolution 128 \   # optional: 128 or 256
   ```

***Inference on other dataset:***
By specifying the `audio_path`, `image_path`, and `output_path` of the `VideoGenerator` class during each inference, and modifying the contents of `directory_name` and `output_video_path` in `unified_video_generator.py` Lines 310-312 and 393-394, you can control the naming logic for saving images and videos, enabling testing on any dataset.
